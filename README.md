# ALU_SYSTEMVERILOG

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
- This project details the comprehensive verification of a parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using a modern, class-based SystemVerilog testbench. The primary objective is to ensure the functional and timing correctness of the ALU design through a structured and reusable verification environment.
### VERFICATION_DOC :
 - Contains documentation for the project.
### VERFICATION_PLAN :
- Contains the test,functional coverage and assertion plan for the project.
  
### VERFICATION_PLAN :
- Contains the code for all the components of the testbench for the project.
